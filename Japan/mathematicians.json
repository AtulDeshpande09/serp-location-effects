Euclid: Father of Geometry, Euclid was a Greek mathematician best known for his treatise on geometry: The Elements. This influenced the development of Western mathematics for more than 2000 years. 3.Al'Khwarizmi: Father of Algebra, Al'Khwarizmi was an Islamic mathematician who wrote on Hindu-Arabic numerals. The word algorithm derives from his name. His algebra treatise Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala gives us the word algebra and can be considered as the first book to be written on algebra. 4.
