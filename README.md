# SERP Location Analysis

This repository summarizes observations and findings from the research effort examining how Google Search results vary by geographic location. The analysis focuses on whether identical queries yield different result rankings, content sources, and search intent prioritization when issued from different regions.

## Overview

Search engines personalize and regionalize results to improve relevance, but this can also influence information exposure. This study compares SERPs for the same queries across distinct geographic locations and documents measurable differences in result ordering and source selection. The work highlights how commercial, cultural, and market-driven factors can reshape information retrieval outcomes.

## Key Findings

* Identical queries can produce significantly different SERP compositions across regions.
* Variance is most pronounced for queries tied to commerce, current events, and culturally contextual information.
* The top three ranked results are the most likely to differ region-to-region.
* Regional search behavior patterns influence how Google prioritizes and interprets relevance.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for studying:

* Geographic bias in search engines
* Information access disparities
* Search personalization effects at scale
